# RecipeBook

A study project to cover the features of the Angular framework.

## Repo's structure

This project has two branches :

-   _master_ : this branch contains the complete logic of the application (including authentication, guards, resolvers...).

-   _demo_ : for more convenience I made a "lightweight" version of the app without the authentication and API calls to host a preview on Netlify (leoncik-recipe-book.netlify.app/)

## Installation

1. Get this repository's content by [direct download](https://github.com/leoncik/Recipe-book/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or by cloning It :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leoncik/Recipe-book.git
```

2. Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on your machine and that you have a package manager (like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)). Then install the dependencies :

```sh
pnpm install
```

3. You are ready to do !

## How to use

Run `pnpm start` to launch a dev server and work on the project.
